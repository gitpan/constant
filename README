Now available is a trial version of constant.pm, a Perl pragma to declare
constants.  Note that some features may be changed in later versions of
this module.  If you want something changed (or not!)  please let me know.

If everything goes right, you should soon be able to find this module
on CPAN in the subdirectory authors/id/PHOENIX.

Use of this module requires something beyond Perl 5.003, but I don't
know what subversion. If you discover that the test suite fails on a
subversion which isn't caught by the 'require' line, please let me know.

If you have any comments, suggestions, patches, bug reports, coffeecakes,
complaints, or ideas, please let me know.

Issues to consider before the final version is released:

    Is it right that this module's name should be 'constant' with a small
    'c'?

    Should this module be bundled with Perl? With 5.004? Should it be
    labelled "experimental"?

    Are any of the bugs (in the BUGS section of the docs, of course)
    too intolerable?

    Is the documentaion sufficiently clear?
